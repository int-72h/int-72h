### I'm int.
 I'm a programmer who programs in Python and a bit of C++ (although it's Valve's limited version, so it's practically just C with classes). 
 Planning on learning Java, proper C, and some OpenGL.

I've currently got a few projects- however I'm also planning on making on a game in the Godot engine.
 
I'll have a proper website up soon, with more info on my current projects, and a blog. But this'll do for now.
