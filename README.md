### I'm int.
 I'm a programmer who programs in _Python_ and a bit of _C++_ (although it's _Valve_'s limited version). Planning on learning _Go_ and _Javascript_.

I've currently got a few projects- however I'm also planning on making on a game in the _Godot_ engine.

I also contribute to the sourcemod _Open Fortress_.
 
I'll have a proper website up soon, with more info on my current projects, and a 'blog'. But this'll do for now.

Q: What's with all the italics?

A: I have no idea- it looked like a good idea at the time.
