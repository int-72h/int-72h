### I'm int.
 I'm a programmer who programs in Python and a bit of C++ (although it's Valve's limited version). Planning on learning Go and Javascript.
 
 I use Linux- Arch to be specific and I'm a fan of the UNIX philosophy as well as the 9front operating system.
 
 I'm planning on working on a game- in the Godot engine. I also contribute to the sourcemod Open Fortress.
 
 I'll have a proper website up soon, with more info on my current projects, and a 'blog'. But this'll do for now.

I'm a fan of the bands New Order, Joy Division and Yes. Also currently learning Hiragana.
