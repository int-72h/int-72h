### I'm int.
I'm a programmer who programs in Python mainly. Planning on learning Java, some C, and maybe OpenGL.

I've currently got a few projects- however I'm also planning on making on a game in the Godot engine.
 
I'll have a proper website up soon, with more info on my current projects, and a blog. But this'll do for now.
