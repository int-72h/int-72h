### I'm int.
 I'm a programmer who programs in _Python_ and a bit of _C++_ (although it's _Valve_'s limited version). Planning on learning _Go_ and _Javascript_.
 
I use _Arch Linux_ as my main OS.
 
I'm interested in the progress of projects like _musl_, making a more compliant OS as well as having pragmatic benefits (better performance and lower 'bloat'.)
 
The concept of the _UNIX_ philosophy and the design _Plan 9 From Bell Labs_ operating system are some of the things I try to take in when programming.
 
I've currently got a few projects- however I'm also planning on making on a game in the _Godot_ engine.

I also contribute to the sourcemod _Open Fortress_.
 
I'll have a proper website up soon, with more info on my current projects, and a 'blog'. But this'll do for now.

I'm also a fan of the bands _New Order_, _Joy Division_ and _Yes_. Also currently learning _Hiragana_.
