### I'm int.
 I'm a programmer who programs in Python and a bit of C++ (although it's Valve's limited version).
 
 I use Linux- Arch to be specific and I'm a fan of the UNIX philosophy as well as the 9front operating system.
 
 I'm planning on working on a game- in the Godot engine.
 
 I'll have a proper website up soon. But this'll do for now.
